              I started learning web development in January 2019. Immediatetly I got totally carried away
              and I wanted to learn more. This website does not have any cool features as it's made with only 
              HTTP and CSS, without any extrenal libaries/bootsrtap etc. Still I think the result was pretty nice,
              it' mobile first, is responsive and the visual appearance of the first page is stunning.
              <br>
              The code itself will certainly have a lot of weird and useless stuff, as one might assume as it was
              my first website.
